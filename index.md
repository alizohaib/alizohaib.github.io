## About Me

Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working under the supervision of Dr. Amir Houmansadr. My research interests focus on network security, internet censorship, and its measurement. Specifically, I am passionate about measuring, analyzing, and developing tools to address large-scale threats to internet users' security and privacy.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I earned my bachelor's degree from the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) in Pakistan and spent two years working as a software engineer at a Seattle-based startup. I recently received the Open Tech Fund's Information Controls Fellowship for the upcoming year.
